# MAXIMA
## A free and open-source replacement for the EA Desktop Launcher
![Logo](images/1500x500.jpg)

> [!WARNING]
> Maxima is pre-pre-pre-alpha-quality software, and is being made open source **prematurely** for [KYBER](https://github.com/ArmchairDevelopers/Kyber), which depends on it. We cannot yet provide any support for attempting to use it standalone, although bug-fixes and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome.

Maxima is an open-source replacement for the EA Desktop/Origin game launcher, running natively on Linux and Windows, with macOS support in progress.

Maxima itself is a server (`maxima_server`) accessed through a client (`maxima_lib`). This provides support for multiple simultaneous frontends, meaning you can, for example, run the CLI and GUI at the same time, and their states will be synced.

We, by default, provide CLI (`maxima_cli`), TUI (`maxima_tui`), and GUI (`maxima_ui`) frontends. Other launchers compatible with Maxima's license may implement it as a backend. It's used by our sister project, [KYBER](https://uplink.kyber.gg/news/features-overview).

**Features:**
 - EA Authentication
 - Downloading/Updating games
 - Download & Play any build of a game
 - DRM & Licensing support
 - Multiplayer game support
 - Syncing EA cloud saves
 - Launch EA games owned on Epic/Steam through Maxima directly
 - Playing games installed with EA Desktop on Maxima + vice versa
 - Displaying your in-game status to your friends, and viewing your friends' status'
 - Locating games (aka. game importing)
 - Running games under [proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) on Linux/SteamDeck
   - `proton-ge` is automatically installed together with [umu](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher).

**In-Dev:**
 - macOS support
 - Support for launching Maxima through Epic/Steam

**Planned:**
 - Library documentation/examples
 - Support for installing DLCs
 - Full EA Desktop interoperability. Games installed with EA Desktop already appear on Maxima, but to take it a step further we'd like the ability to, for example, start a download on EA Desktop and continue it on Maxima.
 - Cleaner/Stabler downloader implementation
 - Progressive/Selective installs
   - Some games are able to start without being fully installed, and some games contain language-specific files
 - Support for the store (buying games)
 - Friend Adding/Removing/Inviting
 - Status setting; locked to "online" at the moment
 - Refactoring Maxima to new architecture allowing multiple frontends to co-exist
 
**Unsupported:**
 - Battlefield 3/4 are currently unsupported due to how battlelog does game launching. This is on our radar, but isn't a huge priority at the moment
   - Please file an issue if you find more games that don't work
 - Old games like Dead Space 2 and BFBC2 are unsupported due to being pre-"Download-In-Place" era games. They have a different manifest format which we need to make a parser for

# CLI Usage
`maxima-cli` standalone will launch an interactive CLI mode to install and launch games.

`maxima-cli help` will bring up the subcommand list, with things like `locate-game`, `cloud-sync`, `create-auth-code`, `list-friends`, etc.

## Why the name 'Maxima'?
It's the farthest you can get from the Origin.
